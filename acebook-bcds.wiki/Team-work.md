**Team Communication:**
1. standup in the morning 9:30 (15 min)
    - to save time, have an agenda
2. retro at end of the day 16:45
3. an absent team-member can look at Trello and catch up with pair partner

**Stand-ups/retros:**
1. if a team-member is absent, we proceed with the standup
2. outcomes will be posted as cards on Trello

**Pairing/Mobbing:**
1. Mob the setup
2. Rotate pair partner each day
3. Discuss and agree on the switching arrangement - e.g. time-based or task-based

**Project Management:**
1. use Trello, ensure Trello is up to date
2. Tasks must be (time) estimated
3. colour-code tasks

**Process document:**
How the workflow was organised, e.g.
1. Tech stack
2. Challenges and how we overcame them
3. What have we learned

**Github:**
- Always pull before starting work
- Change pairs every day _remove? Not GitHub related, already mentioned in Pairing/Mobbing_ 
- Mob on set up - change driver every 15 mins - (end to end MVP) _remove? Not GitHub related, already mentioned in Pairing/Mobbing_ 
- Every time a pair pushes to master, the other pair stops what they are doing and rebases to master.
